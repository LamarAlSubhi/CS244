# Assignment 1: Custom One-Way Delay (OWD) Measurement Using Python

### Objectives
- Implement a Python client-server socket program to measure one-way delay.
- Use time synchronization methods (e.g., NTP or simplified local sync).
- Measure and compare OWD across wired and wireless interfaces.
- Analyze the relationship between OWD and network conditions (e.g., interface type, packet size, load).

### Requirements
1. Time Sync Setup:
    - Simulate time synchronization between client and server.
    - Assume near-perfect sync or apply a simple NTP-like model (e.g., roundtrip-based estimation).

2. Client Program:
    - Sends timestamped packets at regular intervals (e.g., every 100ms).
    - Logs sent timestamps and sequence numbers.

3. Server Program:
    - Receives packets, timestamps them upon arrival.
    - Logs received time and sequence number.

4. OWD Computation:
    - OWD = (Server Receive Time) âˆ’ (Client Send Time)
    - Implement client-side and/or server-side processing to calculate delays.

5. Test Scenarios:
    - Use both wired and wireless interfaces (e.g., eth0 vs wlan0).
    - Vary packet size, interval, and background load.

6. Plots and Analysis:
    - Plot delay over time for both interfaces.
    - Plot packet loss (if any).
    - Compare average OWD, variance, and jitter.

### Tools and Libraries
- socket, time, datetime, argparse (standard libraries)
- matplotlib or seaborn for plotting
- numpy or pandas for statistics
